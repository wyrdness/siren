      "full": "Sirens are dangerous creatures from Greek mythology who lured sailors to shipwreck on rocky coasts with their irresistibly beautiful singing. In original Greek tradition, sirens were depicted as bird-women (similar to harpies but beautiful singers rather than snatchers), combining a woman's head with a bird's body. Later artistic tradition, particularly from the medieval period onward, conflated them with mermaids, depicting them as fish-tailed women. The sirens inhabited rocky islands or coastlines, particularly the Sirenum scopuli (Siren Rocks). Their enchanting songs promised knowledge and pleasure but led to destruction. The most famous encounters include Odysseus, who had his crew plug their ears with wax and tied himself to the mast to hear the song safely, and Orpheus, who out-sang them with his lyre. According to some traditions, sirens would die if a sailor successfully resisted their song. They symbolize temptation, dangerous allure, and fatal distraction, with 'siren song' entering modern language as a metaphor for irresistible but dangerous temptation."
