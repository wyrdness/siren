## Overview

Sirens are dangerous creatures from Greek mythology who lured sailors to their deaths with irresistibly beautiful singing. In original Greek tradition, sirens were depicted as **bird-women** (similar to harpies but beautiful singers rather than snatchers), combining a woman's head with a bird's body.

Later artistic tradition, particularly from the medieval period onward, conflated them with **mermaids**, depicting them as fish-tailed women. This transformation represents one of the most significant evolutions in mythological imagery.

The sirens inhabited rocky islands or coastlines, particularly the **Sirenum scopuli** (Siren Rocks). Their enchanting songs promised knowledge and pleasure but led to destruction.

They symbolize temptation, dangerous allure, and fatal distraction, with "**siren song**" entering modern language as a metaphor for irresistible but dangerous temptation.
